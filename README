Project no: 6

Project description:
A complete playable game with following features:
	- A player class that can move left and right, jump and shoot
	- Enemy sprites that uses observer pattern to avoid contact with the player
	- Projectiles ( spears ) that are used to kill the enemy sprites.
	- Object Pooling for the projectiles
	- Parallax Scrolling and Painters algorithm to give an effect of depth 
	- Explosion and 
	- Sound

Where I got my sprites: 

The background was taken from:
https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-halloween-2d-game-backgrounds/

The player sprite was taken from :
https://craftpix.net/freebies/2d-fantasy-knight-free-sprite-sheets/

The enemy sprites were taken from : 
https://craftpix.net/freebies/2d-game-zombie-character-free-sprite-pack-1/

Witch Sprites were taken from : 
http://www.freepik.com

Music and Sounds were taken from : 
http://soundbible.com/royalty-free-sounds-1.html

What sprite did I create (not Sprite or MultiSprite):
Knight -> This is the player who can be controlled by a, d to move left and right respectively 
ghosts and Zombie -> these are smart sprites that has AI. 
Spear -> The projectile.
Witch -> Simple Two way sprite for Painters algorithm

The easiest part of this project:
Implementing the painters algorithm.

Problems that I had in completing this project:

The player looses life if the player comes in contact with the explosion. Couldn't figure out a solution for this. 

Adding sounds threw an error. So I have commented out the lines that relate to sound. Please uncomment/comment if errors pop up. 

The following lines corrospond to sound:
engine.h	-> line 54
engine.cpp	-> lines 75, 264, 275, 339. 


Game Instructions: 
The goal of the game is to defeat all enemies. The enemy count is on the bottom left of the screen. Player lives are on bottom right. Avoid contact with the enemy sprites and explosions. Contact with explosions causes instant death. 

Controls:
A and D -> Left and Right
Space 	-> Jump
LShift	-> Shoot
R 		-> Restart
G		-> GodMode
E		-> Self Explode
